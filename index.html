### Part 1 Finding your Census Variables
# First you will need to install your census api
# The census API should have been gotten from https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html
# using the census_api_key function here put in your api key.  
# If you want to not have to do this every time you want to download census data, then add the second argument of install=TRUE.  If you choose this, then you might need to restart R. 
census_api_key("c71d4a278773ff7ad70c454369b1851f935b1a34")
#alternative would be census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE", install=TRUE)



# Loading the Possible Census Variables -----------------------------------
# Now we need to load the variables to determine which ones would be the best for us.
# using the load_variables() function to load an dataframe that tells you the codes for the variables we want to extract.
# First we will load the American Community Survey (ACS) 5 year estimates 2016-2020(last available ACS with tidycensus).
# First argument is the year,second is the dataset (acs is the complete ACS dataset), and third is just left as cache=false
ACS<-load_variables(2020,
                    "acs5",
                    cache=FALSE)


# Check out what it brought back.  Looks like 27,040 observations of 3 variables
head(ACS)
# now lets open the dataframe and catch all the codes for the topic you are most interested in.
view(ACS)



### Let's grab some variables
### Race/ethnicity variables come in counts of the population
### Since it is counts, that is only going to pick up on the most populated areas and not based on concentration
### Due to this issue, we are going to have to do a simple calculation

# EXAMPLE 1- Grabbing the White alone population and turning it into a %
### Using the get ACS Function we can get these counts
#First we define the list of variables that we want to pull and give them better names then the code
# To make the list it just your objectlistname <- then c() which means combine items into a vector.  Then inside the c() you are defining your items and names.
# Since the names from the census API are those codes that don't have a lot of meaning, we give it meaning with the MHI =, where that code will be saved with the name MHI
Variables<-c(MHI = "B19013_001", # Median Household Income
             WhitePop = "B01001A_001", # Median Home Value
             Totalpop = "B01003_001", # Total Population
             BlackPop = "B01001B_001")

State<-get_acs(geography = "state",  #Defining the spatial scale
                      variables = Variables, #grabbing the variables we defined previously
                      survey = "acs5",      # survey we are pulling is the ACS 5 year estimates
                      year = 2020,   # End year for the 5 year estimates- 2016-2020
                      output = "wide", # data format wide (cross sectional)
                      geometry=T) # Pulls the spatial data information with it.

#Check out your data a little bit, it brought back 3220 observations of 9 variables
# First 10 records/observations return
head(County)

# summary() provides an overview of the data
summary(County)

# Notice how there is two numbers and columns for each of the variables? ex. MHIE and MHIM
# MHIE or the ones with an E on the end are the estimate, while the MHIM or ones with M are margin of error
# For the purposes of this lab we only care about the estimates
# Lets clean up this data a little bit before we go too far
# Here we are just pulling out the columns we care about using the indexing dataframe[,c("column name","etc")]
States<-State[,c("GEOID", "NAME", "MHIE", "WhitePopE", "TotalpopE","BlackPopE", "geometry")]
# Easy renaming of the variables
names(States)[names(States) =="MHIE"]<-"MHI"
names(States)[names(States) =="WhitePopE"]<-"WhitePop"
names(States)[names(States) =="TotalpopE"]<-"Totalpop"
names(States)[names(States) =="BlackPopE"]<-"BlackPop"

### Setting up the color palletes
### To get the color schemes you will need to set these up
# The instructions have the different color palettes you can choose
# domain is the data that you want to create breaks for.  Here the domain for each of these is the variable
# n says the number of colors and breaks that you will need.  By making that 10 here we are making a color palette for deciles or 10%.
# Lowest values would be in the bottom 10% and highest in the top 10%
palMHI<-colorQuantile(palette = "viridis", domain=States$MHI, n=10)
palWhitePop<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdYlBu", domain=States$WhitePop, n=10)
palpop<-colorQuantile(palette = "RdBu", domain=States$Totalpop, n=10)
palBlackPop<-colorQuantile(palette = "magma", domain=States$BlackPop, n=10)

### The Leaflet map
